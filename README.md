# My TensorFlow Deep Learning Journal Repository

This repository is my personal journal for studying and experimenting with TensorFlow and deep learning concepts. It is a comprehensive documentation of my journey, tracking my understanding of machine learning and deep learning fundamentals, as well as practical applications.

The journal is divided into 5 main sections:

1. **Introduction**: This section records my initial steps into the world of machine learning, where I've learned about data preprocessing and techniques for model selection and evaluation.
2. **Deep Learning Fundamentals**: Here, I've delved into the core aspects of deep learning, including neural networks, activation functions, loss functions, optimization, and explored regularization techniques like dropout.
3. **Advanced Deep Learning Techniques**: This part of the journal chronicles my exploration of more advanced architectures and techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transfer learning and fine-tuning.
4. **Deep Learning Applications**: This section showcases my attempts to apply the learned theories into specific domains, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Time Series Analysis.
5. **Final Project**: This is where I've put my knowledge to test by constructing a deep learning model and preparing it for a hypothetical real-world deployment.

The repository includes both written observations and coded implementations, along with supporting diagrams, exercises, and additional resources I've found useful. I've also kept an online journal that parallels this repository.

Additionally, I've made use of the GitHub Discussions tab as a space for reflecting on my progress, posing questions to myself, and noting down future steps or resources to explore. It's been a great tool for tracking my thoughts and ideas.

This repository encapsulates my journey through TensorFlow and deep learning, acting as a comprehensive record of my learning path.
