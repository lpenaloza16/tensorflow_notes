# TensorFlow Deep Learning Course Repository

This is the official GitHub repository for the TensorFlow Deep Learning course. It's designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of machine learning and deep learning fundamentals and applications.

The course is divided into 5 main sections:

1. **Introduction**: Familiarize yourself with the basics of machine learning, data preprocessing, and model selection and evaluation.
2. **Deep Learning Fundamentals**: Dive deep into the core concepts of deep learning, including neural networks, activation functions, loss functions, optimization, and regularization techniques like dropout.
3. **Advanced Deep Learning Techniques**: Learn about advanced architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and methodologies like transfer learning and fine-tuning.
4. **Deep Learning Applications**: Apply your knowledge to specific domains like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Time Series Analysis.
5. **Final Project**: Test your skills by building a deep learning model and preparing it for real-world deployment.

The repository includes lessons in both code and text format, along with associated slides, exercises, and additional resources. Course materials are also available as an online book.

The GitHub Discussions tab serves as a community hub for asking questions, sharing ideas, and providing feedback. Feel free to join the discussion at any time!

This course aims to be a one-stop-shop for everything you need to start your deep learning journey with TensorFlow.
